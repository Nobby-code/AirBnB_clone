AirBnB clone - The console

The AirBnB is a shell project which runs in the console. It runs in both interactive and non-interactive modes

The command interpeter console is used to manipulate the powerful storage system. The storage gives abstraction between the object and how they are stored.

The command does the following:

    Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
    Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
    Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
    Update attributes of an object
    Destroy an object

Each task is linked and will help you to:

    put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
    create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
    create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
    create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
    create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
